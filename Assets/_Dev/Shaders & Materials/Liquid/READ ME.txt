Setup:
1. Copy the shader and Liquid scripts.

2. Create a material from the shader.

3a. Copy your object, set it as a child, and scale it down a little, add glass material to the parent.

3. Add liquid material to your container.

4. Add the Liquid Script to your container (Itâ€™s set to ExecuteInEditMode, so it should work right away, just adjust the fillamount float)

5. Control the distortion with the _WobbleX and _WobbleZ values from script.
